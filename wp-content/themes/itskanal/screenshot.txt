Theme Screenshot Placeholder

To add a theme screenshot:
1. Create a PNG image 1200x900 pixels
2. Name it "screenshot.png"
3. Place it in the theme root directory: wp-content/themes/itskanal/
4. This will appear in Appearance → Themes

The screenshot should show the homepage design of the iTS KANAL website.

You can use the original site's screenshot or create one after the site is fully set up by:
1. Taking a full-page screenshot of the homepage
2. Cropping it to 1200x900 pixels
3. Saving as screenshot.png
